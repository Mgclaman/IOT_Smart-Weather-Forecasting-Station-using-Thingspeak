In the contemporary era, accurate weather forecasting system has become 
indispensable for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster 
management. This project aims to develop an innovative Weather forecasting System 
using advanced sensors and IoT (Internet of Things) technology to provide real-time 
weather data and forecasts. 
The system integrates multiple sensors to measure key environmental parameters such 
as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall. These sensors are 
connected to a microcontroller that processes the data and transmits it to a cloud-based 
platform via a wireless network. The cloud platform stores and analyse the data, offering 
insightful visualizations and predictive analytics. 
Key features of the Weather Monitoring System include: 
• Real-time Data Collection: Continuous monitoring and immediate data 
reporting. 
• Remote Accessibility: Data can be accessed from anywhere through a web 
interface or mobile application. 
• Predictive Analytics: Advanced algorithms analyse historical and real-time data 
to forecast weather conditions. 
• Scalability: The system can be expanded to include additional sensors and 
cover larger geographic areas. 
 
This Weather forecasting System aims to enhance decision-making processes, improve 
agricultural productivity, and bolster disaster preparedness by providing timely and 
accurate weather information. The integration of IoT technology ensures efficient data 
handling and user-friendly accessibility, making it a vital tool for modern weather 
monitoring and analysis. 
 
In summary, this Weather Monitoring System represents a significant advancement in 
how we collect, analyse, and utilize weather data, providing crucial insights that can 
drive better decision-making across various sectors
